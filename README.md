React Sudoku by AhmetAzizov

* A minimalistic Sudoku puzzle created using React and TypeScript. Is similar to my previous version of the game which I had made with plain JavaScript.
Designed for desktop only. Planning to design the mobile version in the near future.

* The game can played using keyboard inputs. Use arrow keys to move around, backspace to delete input, esc key to remove focus. Clicking off the game canvas will remove focus aswell.
